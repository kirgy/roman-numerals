# Roman Numerals

## Introduction
This repo contains a TypeScript project which aims to convert any given decimal integer to Roman Numerals.

I took the opportunity to exercise a strict TDD approach to development here - unit test the next behaviour, code a solution for that test, and not think too far ahead. There are pros and cons to this approach in the real-world, but given this is a Kata - I took the opportunity for learning.
